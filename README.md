# Singing Materials

### What is the Singing Materials project?

- Singing Materials explores the sonification of phonon data.
- The project team are myself, [Prof. Paul Vickers](https://paulvickers.github.io/), [Dr Adam Parkinson](https://peoplefinder.lsbu.ac.uk/researcher/825yv/dr-adam-parkinson), [Prakriti Kayastha](https://prakayastha.github.io/) and [Ify Nwabuokei](https://github.com/ifylala).
- This project is at an early stage, with software development happening [here](https://github.com/nu-cem/singing-materials) and [here](https://github.com/nu-cem/singing-materials-app).
- Our starting point is the audification of phonon data  (mapping phonon frequencies to the audible range).
- In the medium term, we would like to explore the use of phonon data for science communication via electronic music performance. Phonon Rave, anyone?
- In the longer term, we would like to explore how phonon sonification may be used for real-time monitoring of molecular dynamics simulations.

### So what *is* a Phonon?

A phonon is a quantum mechanical particle of heat. 

When we imagine atoms in a material we may think of something perfectly static, unmoving.
However even at absolute zero the atoms are vibrating with energy.
Phonons are used to describe the vibrations of a crystalline material (a material formed with atoms in a periodically repeating geometric array).
These vibrations are important because they affect a whole host of material properties, like electrical conductivity.
They also

You can visualise phonons [here](https://henriquemiranda.github.io/phononwebsite/phonon.html).
There are also some articles for a more general audience [here](https://news.mit.edu/2010/explained-phonons-0706) and [here](https://www.reading.ac.uk/infrared/technical-library/absorption-theory/thermal-vibrations), for example.

Or, to quote chat GPT, after prompting with `explain what a phonon is for a general audience`:

> Sure! Imagine you're holding a string on a guitar or a rubber band. When you pluck that string or stretch the rubber band and then let it go, it starts to vibrate, right? As it vibrates, it produces sound waves that you can hear.
>
> Now, think about the tiny particles that make up everything around us, like atoms and molecules. Just like the guitar string or the rubber band, these particles can also vibrate, but in a different way. They don't make sound waves like the guitar string does, but they create something called "phonons."
>
> A phonon is like a tiny packet of energy associated with these vibrations of particles in a material. It's the way energy moves through a solid material by causing the particles to wiggle and jiggle. You can think of phonons as the "quanta" or individual units of these vibrations, similar to how light can be thought of as made up of particles called photons.
>
> So, when you heat up a metal rod or any solid object, you're actually giving energy to these phonons, making the particles inside it vibrate faster and spread that heat energy. Without phonons, heat wouldn't be able to move through materials, and things like cooking, heating your home, or even your computer's microchips wouldn't work as they do. In short, phonons are like the messengers that carry heat energy by making tiny particles dance and transfer that heat from one place to another.

### How can I run your code?

The code is currently in development, and is in a fragile (ie, easily broken) state.

To run through the code in the notebook follow these setup instructions: [TODO]

### How can I get involved?
